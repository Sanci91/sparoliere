The mind-blowing word game

This game is based on a "bug-fixing feature" of our brain. In fact we are able to understand words even if some character is wrong or swapped. This because our brain automatically elaborate what we read and make it understandable.
But are we able to bypass our brain and see if a word is really written properly under stress?


# Instructions

You have simply to say if a word is written right or wrong.  Easy, isn't it?
But to make it a bit more difficult you have to do it in a short time. Every time you guess the word, the timer decrease. When you finish all the words in a level, you pass to the next one, where the words are longer.
This make the game harder level by level.

To help you speed up a bit, you can even use the keyboards to reply faster (than clicking on the buttons).

The project is in italian, a version in English will be provided as soon as the project is in a stable version.
